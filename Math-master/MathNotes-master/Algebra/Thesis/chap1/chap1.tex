~~~In this thesis, we study some homological constructions over
a ring $R$ of characteristic $2$. The reason we specialize to case
where the ring has characteristic $2$ is merely for simplicity. Indeed,
nearly all of our results can be generalized by replacing $R$ with
any ring with arbitary characteristic.

~~~In the second chapter, we introduce preliminary material. Section
2.1 of deals with the theory of Gröbner bases. The main references
we used for this section are \cite{CLO15} and \cite{GP08}. Section
2.2 deals with graded rings and modules. In this section we used various
references, namely \cite{GP08}, \cite{BH98}, and \cite{E99}. Section
2.3 deals with homological algebra. Here, our main reference is \cite{E99},
but we also used \cite{KCExterior}, \cite{BH98}, and \cite{stack}
as well. Section 2.4 deals with simplicial complexes and simplicial
homology. We use \cite{MP99} as a reference here. 

~~~In the third chapter, we study some homological constructions
over a field $K$ of characteristic $2$. In section 3.1, we construct
some chain complexes over $K$. We first show how the polynomial ring
$K[x_{1},\dots,x_{n}]$ can be equipped with the differential $d:=\sum_{\lambda=1}^{n}\partial_{x_{\lambda}}$
so that it becomes a chain complex over $K$. We then use the theory
of Gröbner bases to show how $K[x_{1},\dots,x_{n}]/I$ can be equipped
with a differential so that it becomes a chain over $K$. In section
3.2, we study differential graded $K$-algebras. In particular, we
classify which of these chain complexes are differential graded $K$-algebras.
In section 3.3, we study the homology of these chain complexes, and
in section 3.4, we give a topological interpretation of these homologies.
Namely, we show how the homology of a chain complex we construct in
3.1 corresponds to the simplicial homology of a simplicial complex. 

~~~In the fourth and final chapter, we study some homological constructions
over a ring $R$ of characteristic $2$. In contrast to the third
chapter, which has more of a topological flavor, this chapter has
more of an algebraic flavor. In this chapter, we show that every finitely-generated
commutative differential graded $R$-algebra is isomorphic to an $R$-algebra
of the form $R[x_{1},\dots,x_{n}]/I$ equipped a differential defined
as linear combination of partial derivatives. We also show how Koszul
complexes and blowup algebras can be interpretted as differential
graded $R$-algebras in this way. We end this chapter with some basic
homology calculations.
