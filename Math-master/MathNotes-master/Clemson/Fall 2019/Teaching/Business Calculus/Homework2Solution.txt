Homework #2 
Solution 

Use this as a study guide for the upcoming test! Pay attention to the footnotes at the end of this document. 

1. What does AROC, ROC (or IROC), and PROC stand for? 
AROC means average rate of change. 
ROC (respectively IROC) means rate of change (respectively instantaneous rate of change). 
PROC means percent rate of change. 

2. Complete the table below1

3. Write the type of change described in each sentence. Highlight the key phrases in each sentence which led 
you to your answer. 
• 
In November 2016, the number of Facebook users was increasing by 2 
thousand per month. ROC 
• 
Between May 2006 
and May 2007, the number of Facebook users increased by 89.4%. Percent 
Change 
• 
From May 2006 
to May 2007, the number of Facebook users increased on average by 1.048 
thousand per 
month. AROC 
• 
Between May 2006 
and May 2007, the number of Facebook users increased by 12.58 
thousand. Change

In November 2006, the number of Facebook users was increasing by 12.5% per month PROC 
1On the test, you’ll probably need to fill out a table like this. You don’t need to worry about filling in the “key phrases” column that 
I added on the homework. I only added that to help you see what to look out for when determining what type of change a sentence 
is describing.

4. v(t) 
meters per second2 
is the velocity of an apple t 
seconds3 
after it falls from a tree. Suppose v(0)= 
0, 
v(1)= 
9.81 and v0(1)= 
9.81. 
4.a. Give a sentence of interpretation for v(1)= 
9.81.4 
Sentence 
of 
Interpretation: 
The apple’s velocity is 9.81 meters per second, 1 second after it has fallen from a 
tree.5 
What: 
The apple’s velocity. 
By 
how 
much: 
9.81 meters per second. 
When: 
1 second after is has fallen from a tree. 

4.b. Give a sentence of interpretation for v0(1)= 
9.816 
Sentence 
of 
Interpretation: 
The apple’s velocity is increasing by 9.81 meters per second per second, 1 second 
after it has fallen from a tree. 
What: The apple’s velocity 
I/D: Increasing7 
By 
how 
much: by 9.81 meters per second per second8 
When: 1 second after it has fallen from a tree. 

4.c. Give a sentence of interpretation for the percent rate of change of the velocity of the apple 1 second after it 
falls from the tree (you need to calculate the percent rate of change first). 
Sentence 
of 
Interpretation: 
The apple’s velocity is increasing by 100% per second, 1 second after it has fallen 
from a tree. 
What: The apple’s velocity 
I/D: Increasing 
By 
how 
much: by 100% per second (remember % per input units) 
When: 1 second after it has fallen from a tree. 

4.d Give a sentence of interpretation for the change of the velocity of the apple between 0 and 1 seconds (you 
need to calculate the change first). 
Sentence 
of 
Interpretation: 
The apple’s velocity increased by 9.81 meters per second, between 0 seconds and 1 
second after it has fallen from a tree. 
What: The apple’s velocity 
I/D: Increased9 
By 
how 
much: by 100% per second 
When: between 0 seconds and 1 second after it has fallen from a tree. 

2The output units usually show up right after the function is introduced. In this case, we have “v(t) 
meters 
per 
second”. Thus, the 
output units are meters 
per 
second. 
3The input units usually show up right after the variable is introduced. In this case, we have “t 
seconds”. Thus, the input units are 
seconds. 
4On the test, you will 
be asked a question like “give a sentence of interpretation for f 
(a)”, where f 
(a) 
is some function f 
evaluated 

at some input a. This means give a sentence of interpretation for the ordered pair (a, f 
(a)). 
5There is no I/D when interpreting ordered pairs. 
6On the test, you will 
be asked a question like “give a sentence of interpretation for f 
0(a)”, where f 
0(a) 
is the derivative 
of some 

function f 
at some input a. This means give a sentence of interpretation for the (instantaneous) 
rate 
of 
change 
of the function f 
at the 

input a. 
7We use “ing” at the end because we are talking about one input, namely 1 second after it falls from the tree. 
8Many people got this part wrong. Remember, the units for rate of change, it’s output units per input units. Always identify what 

your output and input units are. By the way, because the phrase “meters per second per second” is weird, people usually abbreviate it 
as “meters per second squared” or “m/s2”. However if a problem like this shows up on the exam, don’t try to abbreviate. Just write 
“meters per second per second”, as weird as it may sound. 

9We use “ed” at the end because we are talking about two inputs, namely 0 and 1 seconds after it falls from the tree.
