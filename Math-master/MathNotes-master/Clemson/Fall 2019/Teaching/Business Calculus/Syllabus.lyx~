WebAssign.
 
\series default
After each section of the text is covered in class, an online homework assignmen
t is due in WebAssign.
 Refer to the Math 1020 course website for information on WebAssign.
 Sign into WebAssign directly through this canvas course (there is NO class
 key).
 If you need help getting started, visit the WebAssign activation center
 in Martin Hall O-10, August 26-28: Monday 9-11 am and 12:30-2 pm; Tuesday
 9 am-2 pm; Wednesday 9-11 am and 12:45-2 pm.
 There is a free 14-day trial period.
 If you already have a WebAssign access code for this textbook, you will
 not need to purchase another access code; if not, be sure to purchase a
 WebAssign access code before the 14-day free trial period ends.
 Due dates for all web assignments are on the course calendar and in canvas.
 If you have questions while working on a web assignment, use the “ask my
 teacher” function, or send an email, or stop by my office.
 For technical difficulties, send an email or call WebAssign student support.
 Mozilla Firefox seems to work best.
 Be sure to download each assignment and check that you have submitted it
 once you have finished.
 Even with an excuse, late work is not accepted; however, three of your
 lowest WebAssign scores will be dropped before your final grade is calculated.

Class Work.
 
\series default
Class work includes quizzes, learning activities, and written homework assignmen
ts.
 You must be in class to receive credit for a quiz or learning activity
 and, even with an excuse, there are no make-ups.
 Written homework assignments are due at the beginning of the class period
 of the due date.
 (You may request a copy of homework by email if you are absent the day
 it is assigned.
 If you will be absent the day that homework is due, you may turn it in
 early, send it with a classmate, or send it electronically before class
 begins.) Even with an excuse, late homework will not be accepted for a grade.
 All students in a group are responsible for discussing and solving the
 problems on a learning activity.
 One paper from each group will be randomly selected to be graded.
 All students in a group receive the same grade.
 The lowest 10% of your scores will be dropped before your final grade is
 calculated.
